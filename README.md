![Acceleration Simulation](images/simulation.png "Acceleration Simulation")
![Power Consumption Simulation](images/consumption.png "Power Consumption Simulation")

The  power consumption shown does not account for drivetrain, motor, inverter and battery inefficiencies.
It is only the energy required to win drag and rolling resistance for a given distance travelled (1 km).
